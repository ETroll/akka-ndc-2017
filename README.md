The code for my talk about Akka.NET, remoting and connecting the actor model to a React+Redux app.

Check out the two feature branches to see actor deployment to a local process (AkkaConsole.exe) and to the same process running on a Raspberry Pi (raspberry.local).

Note that RabbitMQ is needed to run the demo.
